    h2 Bonar is shutting down
    p
      |
        Survey results are in and looking at them almost no one is willing to pay for using this service.
        I am no longer a student so I have no interest in using it myself.
        My time is not free and neither is web hosting.
        So there is only one possible outcome - shutting down Bonar.
        At one point from now untill the end of the year this page will no longer exist.

      |  but I can provide you with the DB dump and any additional information you would want.
